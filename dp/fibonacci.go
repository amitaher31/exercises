/*
Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
So Fibonacci sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
That is, F0 = 0, F1 = 1
and
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2  for n > 1.
fib(0) = 0
fib(1) = 1
fib(2) = 1
fib(3) = 2
fib(4) = 3
fib(5) = 5 ..
fib(9) = 34
fib(10) = 55
